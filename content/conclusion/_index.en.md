## What have we accomplished?

### We have

* Created simple containerized application **cats and dogs** on Amazon ECS, which is **fully managed container orchestration** service.
* Chose right **launch type** either **EC2** or **Fargate** for each service. 
* Managed Docker images of **cats** and **dogs** in Amazon ECR.
* Monitored ECS cluster and services in Amazon CloudWatch **Container Insights**.
* Centralized **container logging** using **AWS FireLens** and Amazon CloudWatch.
* Scaled automatically ECS services and even cluster to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

## We have NOT
* deployed a single server to configure, manage, patch, or reboot!
