![Architecture](../../static/images/intro/architecture.svg)

## We will:
* Manage Docker images of **cats** and **dogs** in Amazon ECR.
* Create Amazon ECS **cluster, task definitions**, and **services**. 
* Choose right **launch type** either **EC2** or **Fargate** for each service.
* Deploy simple containerized application **cats and dogs** path-routed through ALB.
* Monitor ECS cluster and services in Amazon CloudWatch **Container Insights**.
* Centralize **container logs** using **AWS FireLens** and Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
* Scale ECS **services** and **cluster** automatically.
